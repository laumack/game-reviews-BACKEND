# **Board-Master:** Backend üé≤
*Backend project for a board game review website* - WORK IN PROGRESS

## Background üìÜ

This project builds an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

The database is [PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and it is interacted with using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Links üîó

>To view the *currently* available **ENDPOINTS**, please visit:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **https://nc-games-xkym.onrender.com/api**  
(you may wish to use a JSON formatter extension to better view this data)

>The frontend repo is here:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **https://github.com/laumack/game-reviews-FRONTEND**

## Plans üìà

This project is a ***work in progress***. Future plans include:
* making use of Express routers to help breakdown the logic into subrouters
* adding the following further endpoints:
    * GET /api/users/:username
    * PATCH /api/comments/:comment_id
    * POST /api/reviews
    * GET /api/reviews (pagination)
    * POST /api/categories
    * DELETE /api/reviews/:review_id 
* refactoring any code and ensuring that all files have been separated by their endpoint type

* Postgres: v14.8

## Install Dependencies üß∞

Install dependencies using:

```
$ npm install
```

## Environment Variables üó∫Ô∏è

To connect to the development and test databases you will need to create an _.env.development_ file and an _.env.test_ file.

Within the _.env.development_ file, add the following code:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_games
```

Within the _.env.test_ file, add the following code:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_games_test

## Seed Databases üå±

There are two databases included with this project, one for the live *development* data, and a smaller one for *test* data.

To seed the databases, you will need to run:

```
$ npm run setup-dbs
$ npm run seed
```

## Run Tests üë©‚Äçüéì

The project was built using Test-Driven Development throughout, with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Jest-Sorted](https://github.com/P-Copley/jest-sorted). As a result, there are comprehensive tests included, which you can run by using:

```
$ npm test
```
