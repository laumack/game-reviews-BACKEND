         1 | Culture a Love of Agriculture With Agricola          | strategy        | Uwe Rosenberg          | tickle122    | You could sum up Agricola with the simple phrase 'Farmyard Fun' but the mechanics and game play add so much more than that. You'll find yourself torn between breeding pigs, or sowing crops. Its joyeous and rewarding and it makes you think of time spent outside, which is much harder to do these days!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://images.pexels.com/photos/974314/pexels-photo-974314.jpeg?w=700&h=700                 | 2021-01-18 10:00:20.514 |     1

        21 | Ganz Schon Clever                                    | roll-and-write  | Wolfgang Warsch        | happyamy2016 | The title translates to "that's so clever" and it won't take you long to realise why. Ganz Schon Clever is a really engagind roll-and-write where you'll try to collect score points from coloured dice. Sounds simple, but the real strategy of this game lies in how you collect the bonuses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://images.pexels.com/photos/516114/pexels-photo-516114.jpeg?w=700&h=700                 | 2020-09-13 15:19:28.077 |     8

Lowe          | grumpy19     | Often thought of as the ultimate roll-and-write game, You'll find it hard to overlook Yahtzee's appeal. Yahtzee is quick to teach and quick to play. Think of it as an essential "palate-cleanser" game to have in your store cupboard for those times when chunkier games leave a bitter taste in players mouths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | https://images.pexels.com/photos/3956552/pexels-photo-3956552.jpeg?w=700&h=700               | 2020-09-13 15:19:20.077 |    18

Escape the Dark Sector takes everything about Escape the Dark Castle that made it wonderful, and then adds guns! Thrust into the future by the imersive chapter cards, your mission remains the same, (thats right, escape!) but the challenges you'll face feel a whole lot more grown up. Cooperative and atmospheric, Escape the Dark Sector brings more variety and a bigger challenge to players. Don't underestimate the dabger of running out of ammo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://images.pexels.com/photos/3910141/pexels-photo-3910141.jpeg?w=700&h=700               | 2021-01-18 10:09:05.61  |    11
